# RLCO-Papers

Reinforcement Learning based combinatorial optimization (RLCO) is a very interesting research area. 
Combinatorial Optimization Problems include: Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Orienteering Problem, Knapsack Problem, Maximal Independent Set (MIS), Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC), Maximal Clique (MC), Intger Linear Programming (ILP), Routing, EDA domain problems. Most of them are NP-hard. 
Combinatorial Problems can traditionally be solved by: exact method, heuristics-based method

This is a collection of resaerch papers of RLCO. Papers are sorted by time and categories. Some related supervised learning papers are also listed as a reference.


The sharing principle of these references here is for research. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact [Haiguang Liao]  (Email: haiguanl [AT] andrew.cmu.edu).

## EDA Application Papers:
Some problems in EDA such as physical design (floorplan, placement, routing, etc.) can be reduced to combinatorial optimization problems. Thus, some of them are solved with RLCO.
