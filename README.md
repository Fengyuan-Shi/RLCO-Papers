# RLCO-Papers

Reinforcement Learning based combinatorial optimization (RLCO) is a very interesting research area. 
Combinatorial Problems include: Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Orienteering Problem, Knapsack Problem, Maximal Independent Set (MIS), Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC), Maximal Clique (MC). Most of them are NP-hard. 
Combinatorial Problems can traditionally be solved by: exact method, heuristics-based method

This is a collection of resaerch papers of RLCO. Papers are sorted by time and categories.


The sharing principle of these references here is for research. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact [Haiguang Liao]  (Email: haiguanl [AT] andrew.cmu.edu).
